                The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of 
                small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated 
                species in the family Felidae and is often referred 
                to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the 
                wild members of the family. A cat can either be a 
                house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges 
                freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are 
                valued by humans for companionship and their ability 
                to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized 
                by various cat registries

                The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid 
                species: it has a strong flexible body, quick 
                reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted 
                to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of 
                smell are well developed. Cat communication includes 
                vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, 
                hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific 
                body language. A predator that is most active at dawn 
                and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter 
                but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint 
                or too high in frequency for human ears, such as 
                those made by mice and other small mammals. Cats also 
                secrete and perceive pheromones.

                Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to 
                late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two 
                to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at 
                events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as 
                cat fancy. Population control of cats may be effected 
                by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and 
                the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers 
                of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction 
                of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species. It was 
                long thought that cat domestication began in ancient 
                Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC, 
                but recent advances in archaeology and genetics have 
                shown that their domestication occurred in Western Asia 
                around 7500 BC.
